## Testimonial

Debian developers can program anything they want!  Debian developers program
ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  These guys are so crazy and
awesome that they flip out ALL the time.  I heard that there was this Debian
developer who was eating at a diner.  And when some dude tried to patent an
algorithm the Debian developer went and released a stable distribution three
years later.   My friend Jaldhar said that he saw a Debian developer totally
uppercut some kid just because the kid used Gentoo.

And that's what I call REAL Ultimate Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you don't believe that Debian developers have REAL Ultimate Power you better
get a life right now or they will not invite you to DebConf!!!  It's an easy
choice, if you ask me.

Debian developers are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't
believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally
awesome and that's a fact.  Debian developers are fast, smooth, cool, strong,
powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start Visual Basic next year.  I
love Debian developers with all of my body (including my pee pee).

## Q and A

- Q: Why is everyone so obsessed about Debian developers?
  A: Debian developers are the ultimate paradox. On the one hand they don't think the GFDL is free, but on the other hand, Debian developers play tetrinet.

- Q: I heard that Debian developers are always cruel or mean.  What's their problem?
  A: Whoever told you that is a total liar.  Just like other mammals, Debian developers can be mean OR totally awesome.

- Q: What do Debian developers do when they're not packaging free software or flipping out?
  A: Most of their free time is spent drinking Coke, but sometime they drink beer.  (Ask Jaldhar if you don't believe me.)
