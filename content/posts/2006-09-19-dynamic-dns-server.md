Done creating config file. You can run the script now.
To do it you can run ipUpdate.pl or use init script. 

File '/tmp/dnsexit-ip.txt' will cache the ip address of
the last successful IP update to our system. For next
update, if the IP stays the same, the update request
won't be sent to our server. You can simply change the 
IP at dnsexit-ip.txt file to force the update to DNSEXIT.

Here are paths to some intresting files:
Pid file: /var/run/ipUpdate.pid
Log file: /var/log/dnsexit.log
Cache file: /tmp/dnsexit-ip.txt

 Don't forget to read README.txt file in doc directory!
