> Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the questions they might ask you. Only questions with a certain priority or higher are actually shown to you; all less important questions are skipped. 
> 
> You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see:
>   - 'critical' is for items that will probably break the system without user intervention.
>   - 'high' is for items that don't have reasonable defaults. 
>   - 'medium' is for normal items that have reasonable defaults.
>   - 'low' is for trivial items that have defaults that will work in the vast majority of cases.
