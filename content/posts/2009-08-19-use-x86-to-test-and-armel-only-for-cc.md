title: use x86 to test and armel only for cc
---

RT @<http://n2.nabble.com/Not-getting-hildon-theme-for-Armel-terget-and-unable-to-build-for-Armel-terget-td2953653.html>

please use the x86 target to test your applications and the armel target *only*
for cross compiling. starting the window from the armel target will fail. For
further information please have a look at the release notes [1].

And the mmap issue is handled here now [2] I guess ;)
