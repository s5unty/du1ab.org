There's no formal process but you've already taken the first step -
mailing this list.

**参与邮件列表**

In addition you also have the IRC channel (#debian-boot on <http://irc.debian.org>)
which in my experience has the most activity from late evening into late 
nights (CET).

**IRC在傍晚到午夜比较活跃**

There's also the wiki page - http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller which
contains lots of information (with a varying degree of completeness).

**分享wiki**

You might find http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Contrib especially interesting.

**选择感兴趣的工作，TODO、翻译、BUG、文档等**

Basically (this is what I did at least), you check out debian-installer
from SVN (see http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/svn), build
some images, hack on it, break it, fix it, build new images, test, create
patches, file bug reports on the relevant packages with patches attached,
discuss with people here and on IRC, etc. 

**对获得的代码进行处理、剖析、修正、编译、测试、创建补丁、提交相关的BUG并且附加补丁、和其他人进行交流等等**

Just, think of what you would like to fix/improve/implement in
debian-installer and then dive right in.

That's the development part of it, there are of course other things which 
need to be done as well, for example bug triage
(http://wiki.debian.org/ProcessingInstallationReports) and translations
(http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/l10n-stats/).
