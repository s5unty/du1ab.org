Beans'OS about author

Welcome to my website, I'm Shaojie Zhou

At this flippancy age. as a programmer, it's easy to lost the glory. I always think that a good programmer should be a knight, with powerful sword and fight for the hope. Although for live, I have to face one troubled after another every day, but I always believe that one day I could carry out my dream. 

Being a programmer is the most lucky thing to me. Thanks the God.

Please consider this project as a toy, I expect buddies with the same hobby, a game with more persons is always more interesting.
